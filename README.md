By working through these modules, you will gain practical experience in:

1. **System Administration**: Managing Linux systems, users, permissions, and services
2. **Automation**: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks and system configurations
3. **Networking**: Understanding network protocols, configuration, and troubleshooting
4. **Web Infrastructure**: Setting up and managing web servers, load balancers, and SSL
5. **Database Management**: Configuring, securing, and maintaining MySQL databases
6. **Configuration Management**: Using Puppet for infrastructure automation
7. **Monitoring & Debugging**: Implementing monitoring solutions and debugging complex issues
8. **Security**: Implementing security best practices for systems and networks
9. **API Development**: Creating and consuming APIs for system integration

## Usage

Each directory contains specific exercises and projects. Navigate to individual directories to find:

- **README.md** - Module-specific instructions and learning objectives
- **Scripts** - Executable files for various tasks
- **Configuration files** - Setup and configuration examples
- **Documentation** - Additional resources and explanations

### Running Scripts

Most shell scripts in this repository are designed to be executable. To run a script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x script_name

# Execute the script
./script_name
```

### Puppet Manifests

Puppet manifests (`.pp` files) can be applied using:

```bash
# Apply a puppet manifest
puppet apply manifest_file.pp
```

### Python Scripts

Python scripts can be executed directly:

```bash
# Run a Python script
python3 script_name.py
```

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or later
- **Shell**: Bash 4.3 or later
- **Python**: Python 3.4 or later
- **Puppet**: Version 3.4 or later
- **Web Server**: Nginx (where applicable)
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7 or later (where applicable)
